            <h2>What is Lore?</h2>
            <p>
                Lore refers to the body of knowledge, stories, traditions, and beliefs that exist within a fictional universe or cultural context. It encompasses the history, mythology, geography, cultures, and characters of a particular setting, providing depth and context to the world in which a story takes place. In the context of video games, lore often includes details about the game world's inhabitants, their customs, languages, religions, and significant historical events. Lore can be conveyed through various mediums such as in-game dialogue, cutscenes, item descriptions, character backstories, and supplementary materials like novels, comics, or developer interviews. It serves to enrich the player's experience by immersing them in a fully realized and coherent fictional universe, allowing them to engage with the world and its characters on a deeper level.
