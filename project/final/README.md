# Fire Emblem

I've decided to make my site on my favortie gaming franchise, Fire Emblem. The games are all tactical role-playing games developed by Nintendo. The gameplay is turn-based on grid maps. I chose this topic because I like gaming and this franchise is one of my favorites. This topic could have a lot informationn I could use for the different pages instead of using filler. Because I play the game, I could use the images I take in game for the pages.

## Can you tell me about the fire emblem franchise

The Fire Emblem franchise is a long-running series of tactical role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. The series debuted in 1990 with the release of "Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryū to Hikari no Tsurugi" ("Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light") for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Japan.

The gameplay typically revolves around turn-based battles on grid-based maps, where players control a group of characters known as "units." Units have various classes, weapons, and abilities, and players must strategically maneuver them to defeat enemies while considering terrain, positioning, and unit strengths and weaknesses.

One of the distinctive features of the Fire Emblem series is its emphasis on permanent death, often referred to as "permadeath." When a unit is defeated in battle, they are permanently removed from the game, adding a layer of strategy and consequence to gameplay. However, in some recent entries, players have been given the option to disable permadeath if they prefer.

## Why is Fire Emblem popular

The series is known for its compelling storytelling, often involving intricate plots, memorable characters, and themes of war, politics, and fantasy. Many games in the series feature interconnected narratives set in the same fictional universe, with recurring elements such as legendary weapons and dragons.

Over the years, the Fire Emblem franchise has grown significantly, with numerous mainline entries, spin-off games, and remakes. Some of the most popular titles in the series include "Fire Emblem: Awakening," "Fire Emblem: Fates," and "Fire Emblem: Three Houses," which was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019 and received widespread critical acclaim for its deep gameplay and rich storytelling.

Accidentally committed setup to the wrong folder but added a position tag so the popular charcetrs heading sticks to the top of the page as you scroll

added css styling to gameplay html and aligned headers and styled footer to match the rest of the pages

added images to gameplay and aligned more headers

modified nav to include headers for this page and learned the bold tag to add at the beginning of paragrpahs when pointing out certain points

there is a sentence that breaks at the end of the gameplay page and i tried using the break element to see if it would help and it didnt so i removed it 

deleted another unused image while adding another and added css to the games page

added css for the site page layout and removed the list type as it doesn't fit how i want it to. 

i added the new subpage on the index page. Its in the lore wise header and it's gonna expalin what lore is and how it fits in the context of fire emblem

modified the games html and delted image i wont be using

decided to make circles for the color palette by using dave's method on flexbox

added a class to each individual box in orddr to add different background colors to each 

added new sub page and added content including images, nav, headers, and footer nav

going to try and implement grid layout on popular layour to design it a little better. I liked the design at first but the images kind of threw me off. I would need to start with a blank page to try and layout the grid or flexbox. Will try again when i have a better handle on it. I could implement it to make columns of the popular games page

grid: trying to set up grid in css. Im starting to understand with the template areas a bit more. Ive added grid template items and the content and page looks really messy so i wonder if i can control the space around the content. Ive added height, width, grid template rows and columns and it looks a bit better but the content is all still on top of each other and id ont know how to fix it. I found out it might be my articles and main clashing together which is why it looks messy. I restarted to try and follow dave's way and it's a bit less confusing. I like his method however he has too many divs and it's confusing trying to do it without them. I think dave's way was the easiest however i was a little lost when trying to add content in the boxes. I feel like every tutorial i watched all had boxes and divs and that made it confusing.

was a little lost on the media queries at first but soon got the hang of it. most difficult part was figuring out why it was working but i mistyped mind instead of min. I forgot how the queries would affect the little images i had on one of my pages and that set me back.
