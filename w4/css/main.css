/* This .center css element is for my sitemap. I tried to do something fun
for the background of my sitemap. I tried out different shapes but ultimately
stuck with what Dave taught us on circles but just made it bigger.
I added text in the middle for my sitemap list. I tried to implement 
fun bright colors but most would not fit or look good. The text and item
align help my text be centered in the middle and the offset indicates
how far the border is from the circle. The margin allows for
my circle to be in the middle of the page instead of being all the way at the top.*/
