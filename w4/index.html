            <h2>About the Franchise</h2>
            <p>Splatoon is a popular third-person shooter video game franchise developed and published by Nintendo. It was first released for the Wii U console in 2015, and later for the Nintendo Switch in 2017 with its sequel, Splatoon 2. The game's unique selling point is its emphasis on ink-based, team-based combat rather than traditional shooting mechanics.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Splatoon focuses on multiplayer matches where two teams of four players each compete against each other in various game modes. The primary mode, Turf War, tasks players with covering as much of the arena floor with their team's colored ink as possible within a time limit. The team that covers the most territory wins. Other modes include Ranked Battles, which include objective-based modes like Splat Zones, Tower Control, and Rainmaker.</p>

                <h3>Ink Mechanic</h3>
            <p>Instead of bullets, players shoot colored ink from various weapons, which can be guns, rollers, brushes, or even buckets. In addition to attacking opponents, the ink serves multiple purposes, such as covering territory, hiding, and swimming. Players can dive into the ink, allowing them to move faster, hide from enemies, and refill their ink supply.</p>

            <p>Players control characters known as Inklings, humanoid beings who can transform between kid and squid forms. Inklings are customizable in terms of appearance, gear, and weaponry. Gear provides various bonuses and abilities that can affect gameplay, such as faster ink recovery or increased movement speed.</p>

            <p>While the main focus is on multiplayer, Splatoon and Splatoon 2 both feature single-player campaigns. These campaigns consist of a series of levels where players navigate platforming challenges, defeat enemies, and ultimately face off against boss characters. The single-player mode helps players learn the game mechanics and serves as a fun diversion from the multiplayer action.</p>
